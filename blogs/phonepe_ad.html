					<b>My Experience at PhonePe.</b>
				</p>
				<h3><b>Anomaly Detection Project</b></h3> 
				<br>
                <p>As a software developer at Phonepe, I had the opportunity to work on a project that was initiated as a result of an actual system failure that had taken place. The Phonepe app, as many of you may know, is a payment gateway that accepts money from one entity and transfers it to another. Unfortunately, due to a synchronization issue between the microservices, there was a 45-minute period where the system was refunding payments to senders and also transferring money to recipients. This incident highlighted the need for an Anomaly Detection System that would be able to detect such anomalies in the future and prevent potential loss.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The project was initiated by the company and was tracked by the Founder/CTO of the company. My role was to develop this Anomaly Detection System and make sure that such issues are detected in the future. The initial requirement was to monitor approximately 5 metrics pointed out by the business team. However, as the project progressed, it developed into a much more sophisticated system that monitored more than 27 metrics that could cause potential loss to the company.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I exceeded the expectations of my managers and was highly appreciated for my work. The system was not only able to detect breaches in hardcoded thresholds but also relative changes in a particular metric. This made it a powerful tool for detecting anomalies in the system. My work on this project was recognized not only within my team but also across different branches of the company. I became known for my contribution in this area.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Anomaly Detection System at Phonepe was a tough yet gratifying project to work on, to sum up. Not only did I have the opportunity to work on a project that had a direct impact on the company, but I also had the chance to develop my skills and gain recognition for my work. I believe that this project has set the foundation for more sophisticated systems that can prevent potential loss to the company in the future. If time permits, I will definitely write a more detailed blog about my contribution in this area and the technical aspects of this project.</p>

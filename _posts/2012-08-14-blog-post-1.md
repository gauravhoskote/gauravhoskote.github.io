For the past several months I have been trying to master the field of Machine Learning. I am no expert in this field and am still in the process of learning, but in this post I would like to share a few Free Resources available online that helped me a lot on this journey.

Mentioned below are a few of them…

Courses for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Theory:
=========
### CS229 — Machine Learning by Stanford University.

- The latest version of this course uploaded on YouTube is taught by Prof. Anand Avati formerly taught by Andrew Ng.
- This Course is an advanced version of the famous Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
- The course covers everything starting from Linear Algebra all the way up to Reinforcement Learning.
- Course links: [CS229 Autumn 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) and [CS229 Summer 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzH1ovd4Ots&list=PLoROMvodv4rNH7qL6-efu_q2_bPuy0adh).

### CS231N — Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

- This might arguably be the best course I have ever taken. There are 2 versions of this course available on YouTube — Winter 2016 and Spring 2017.
- The Winter 2016 course is taught by Andrej Karapathy and the course is uploaded on his YouTube Channel. The explanation of each and every concept is detailed yet lucid.
- The Spring 2017 version taught by Justin Johnson has a few extra topics covered compared to the 2016 version. The CS231N team has taken efforts to keep the syllabus up to date.
- Course Links: [CS231N Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) and [CS231N Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).


CS224N — NLP with Deep Learning.
=========
- Taught by Christopher Manning, this course is about Deep Learning techniques used in Natural Language Processing Tasks.
- I personally feel they could have included more code examples as it could be a little tricky for people with no math background to bridge the gap from theory to code.
- You can also check out CS224U — Natural Language Understanding which covers topics in similar areas.
- Course Links: [CS224N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXD5-xhemo&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z) and [CS224U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ_Jrc_nRJY&list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20).


Courses for building a math background:
=========
### Statistics 110: Probability by Harvard University.
- People referring to this course solely for learning ML concepts can skip the counting part and start from lecture 8 (Random variables). 
- I still recommend watching the entire course as there as references to topics covered in previous lectures like Vandermonde’s identity etc and also because its a lot of fun!
- Much of what is covered in this series will help you understand CS229 (by Anand Avati) as it requires firm background in probability and Statistics.
- Course Link: [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo).

### Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus:
- I have not taken an entire course because I was fairly confident in this area but there are videos uploaded on YouTube by MIT Opencourseware on both these topics.
- Course Links: [Multivariate Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxCxlsl_YwY&list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38) and [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D&index=1).

Bonus: People uncomfortable with Math and Probability can refer to DeepLearning.ai. (YouTube Channel) [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/Deeplearningai)

Programming Channels for ML/DL:
=========
- I used Pytorch documentation which has enough code samples. But if you are accustomed to consuming content in the form of videos then Sentdex, Krish Naik, Deep Lizard, Codebasics, are some YouTube channels that you might want to check.
- Aladdin Persson is a very underrated YouTuber whose Github repository and YouTube Channel has helped me learn CNN architectures. Link: [Aladdin’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AladdinPersson) and [Github](https://github.com/aladdinpersson).

These were a few resources that I knew of. Feel free to share any resources that helped you too. :)
